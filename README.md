# MiBeX: Malware-Inserted Benign Datasets for Explainable Machine Learning

This repo contains the LaTeX for my undergraduate capstone report at UC.
It was funded by The Design Knowledge Company (TDKC) and Air Force Research
Laboratory (AFRL) under AFRL Award No. FA8650-18-C-1191.

## Code

I will post a link to a repo with the code used for this report when it is
approved for public release.

## Publications

The work was then extended over the summer into a publication as a
[book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64949-4_9)
in [Interpretable Artificial Intelligence: A Perspective of Granular Computing
](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-64949-4).
I am currently looking at options for self-archiving as specified in the
publishing agreement, and I will link it when I have it set up.
